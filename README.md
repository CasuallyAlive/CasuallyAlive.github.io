Go to 'www.jordylarrea.me' to view the website. 
# Purpose
****************
The website serves as a front for my resume/portfolio and provides potential recruiters with a conveneient way to learn more about me as it
corresponds to my qualifications and interests. This website was developed with traditional web-development technologies such as html, css, and javascript. In fact,
this website was intended as an exercise for me to get familiar with said technologies. 

# Libraries/API's Used
***************************
JQuery was used to implement a timed event driven background image transition and to ease dynamic setup of element styling in general. For the hobbies section of the website I intend on adding stats from Chess.com and last.fm, so 
data will be extracted utilizing available api's from the aforementioned services.
